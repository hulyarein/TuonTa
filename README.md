### About 
TuonTa is an innovative study partner app designed to enhance academic performance through the power of shared accountability and focused collaboration. Inspired by the Hawthorne Effect, which demonstrates that individuals perform better when they feel observed, TuonTa addresses the need for students to connect with study partners who share similar academic interests and habits. By fostering a sense of shared reality—where students align on common goals and experiences—our app aims to boost productivity and accountability in learning environments.

TuonTa combines the familiarity of popular social apps with academic purpose, offering features like profile creation, swiping to match with compatible study buddies, and group video chats to create a supportive, distraction-free study atmosphere.
